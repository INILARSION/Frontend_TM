# Frontend for the Turing machine suit

For this frontend **Python3** and **Django** have to be installed.

To run the frontend execute `python3 manage.py runserver 8000`.

Now you can access the Webinterface over [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/).

There is also a [Docker version](https://github.com/INILARSION/Fronted_TM_Docker) of this project.
